            <h2>About The Beatles</h2>
            <article>
                <p>The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With a lineup comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, they are regarded as the most influential band of all time. The group was integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form.</p>
                
                <p>Led by the primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. They produced what critics consider some of the finest music in their era and their tremendous popularity helped lift spirits in America following the November 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</p>
                
                <p>The Beatles have sold more than 800 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling music act of all time. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart, most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and most singles sold in the UK. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all four main members were individually inducted between 1994 and 2015.</p>
                
                <p>Their innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s and their influence on pop culture is unparalleled. They not only changed music but influenced fashion, lifestyle, politics, and youth culture in ways that continue to resonate today.</p>
